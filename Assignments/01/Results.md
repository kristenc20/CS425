## Improvement Iterations

Here's a table showing the improvements I did to make the application go faster.  The **Time** column in the table represents the _wall-clock time_ for a program run.

| Version | Time | Speedup | Memory (KB) | Changes |
| :-----: | ---- | :-----: | :------: | ------- |
| [01](01.cpp) | 9.64s | &mdash; | 1041332 | Initial version - no changes |
| 02 | 3.32s | 2.9x | 1041324 | Compiled with -O1 to see about minimizing memory usage |
| [03](03.cpp) | 1.92s | 5.02x| 1041328 | Compiled with -O3 instead
